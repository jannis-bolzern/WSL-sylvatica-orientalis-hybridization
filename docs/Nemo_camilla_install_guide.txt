 Steps to install nemoage in Windows
-----------------------------------------
1) install Cigwin 
2) verify this by running 

	cygcheck -c libgsl-devel 

in the Cygwin terminal. If it’s not installed, rerun the Cygwin setup and select the libgsl-devel package

NB: During the Cygwin setup, make sure to select the following packages:
gcc-core
gcc-g++
libgsl-devel
make
You can select these packages during the setup by searching for them in the package selection screen.

3) Extract the nemoage0.32.2.tgz file within Cygwin by running 

	tar -xvzf /path/to/nemoage0.32.2.tgz

4) change to the extracted directory

	cd nemoage0.32.2

5) check the Makefile for any configuration changes

	nano Makefile

list of commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt install build-essential  
$ mkdir bin
$ sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev

12) Close Ubuntu
13) Go back to windows and download the version of Nemo you want to run. 
14) In you Ubuntu home folder (Ubuntu/home/<username>, at the bottom of your file explorer sidebar under Linux) create a folder called nemoage0.32.X and place the downloaded archive there
15) Open ubuntu again as administrator and run the following commands. Again do not include the $ in your commands

$ cd ~/nemoage0.32.x
$ mkdir -p obj/src
$ tar -xvzf nemoage0.32.x.tgz
$ make

16) open the Makefile and change the BIN_INSTALL directory with the path where you want to run the program, like  
BIN_INSTALL = /home/camilla/nemoage0.32.4/ or /home/camilla/nemoage0.32.4/exe/
and run 

$ make install

this will copy the program to the folder where you want to run it

16) place in that folder all the files to run nemo 
17) run nemo taping

--------------------------------------------
 Steps to recompile nemoage to upgraded version (to check)
--------------------------------------------

1) make the new folder for the new version 

$ mkdir ~/nemoage0.32.x

2) put the new nemo folder in the new directory 

$ cd ~/nemoage0.32.new (new version)
$ cp -r /path/to/new/nemoage0.32.x-src.tgz ~/nemoage0.32.x/

3) uncompress the scr folder

$ tar xvf nemoage0.32.x-src.tgz

4) copy all the additional files in from the previous version (getVersion.sh, Makefile and bin folder with Nemo exe file)

$ cp ~/nemoage0.32.old/* ~/nemoage0.32.new/
$ cp -r ~/nemoage0.32.old/bin ~/nemoage0.32.new/

5) update the BIN_INSTALL path: open the Makefile in the directory, make sure that BIN_INSTALL is something like /home/camilla/nemoage0.32.5/

$ nano ~/nemoage0.32.5/Makefile

6) recompile the new version after clearing existing compiled files to avoid conflicts

$ mkdir -p obj/src
$ make

5) install the updated version (check the Name …)

$ make install

6) change the permissions if needed 

$ ls -l ~/nemoage0.32.5/exe
$ chmod +x ~/nemoage0.32.5/exe/nemoage0.32.5
